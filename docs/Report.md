# Report

**Disclaimer:** Since this project was created as part of an internship project (Erasmus+), we have chosen to include a report on our development process and our decisions regarding the project. This report is not part of the documentation and is not needed if you want to do this project yourself, as it will not explain anything, that is not already explained in the documentation.

## Abstract

## The development process

This project by itself is not very complicated and could, with more experience, probably be finished with more features even sooner, but we had to define our goals and be very realistic about them, since the project had to be finished within three weeks. Even when the program is over we will still continue to improve it, as we have a lot of ideas on how it could be a lot better.

We started the project with an initial suggestion by our mentor. The idea was to create a localised Minecraft server, that had no connection to the internet. Our target demographic were parents, who wanted their children playing Minecraft without the hating environment that is sometimes present on public servers. Our first major decision was if we wanted to use Mojang's official Minecraft Server or Spigot as a template for our implementation. We have chosen to go with Spigot for a couple of reasons. While it isn't as stable as the official server, it offers more frequent updates, is very plugin-friendly, has a great community backing it up and most importantly, it has a lot of performance improvements over the official server.

With this decision out of the way we started the development with [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) as our base, since it best fits our needs. Since this server is a headless box (it doesn't need a GUI), there is no need for a desktop environment and all the visual tools that come with it. This also decreases the already big storage requirement. With Raspbian Stretch Lite the initial size is about 1.7 GB and the whole project should be about 2 GB. This theoretically means we could fit it onto a 4 GB SD Card without a problem, but because of the typical Read/Write speeds of such small SD Cards this would be a significant bottleneck. This is why we chose a Class U1 8 GB SD Card, although we could have chosen a bigger one if needed. Once the installation was finished we updated and upgraded the Pi, to get the latest release of all the programs and the Raspbian kernel. Then we continued by installing or rather moving the built Spigot.jar file, which was built using Spigot's [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/). The tool was also later used by Nejc Jezer≈°ek to build his custom plugin, which uses the Spigot API. After running and configuring the server we chose to use the **screen** program to ease the management and restarting process of the server. After writing some scripts and testing the server, we started working on the web management console, which was mostly written in php. The last thing to was again testing everything. After installing and building some plugins the project was practically completed. Of course there were some complications during the development of the project, but we have overcome most with ease. One of the bigger problems we had and still do have are permissions. Currently, because we are nearing the deadline, most of the files on our released image file are owned by root, which could prove a security voulnerability. While this should be an easy fix, by just adjusting some permissions and adding the www-data user to the pi group, we have chosen to not do this for our first release. If a user decides to follow our instructions on manually moving the files to the Pi, this won't be the problem, as he will have to manually edit these permissions. THis is definitely a priority issue, and will definitely be fixed within a few days of releasing this report. Another bigger problem, which we have already overcome, was controlling the server using php. To fix this we have modified some scripts and executed them from php, instead of executing separate commands from php. Our biggest problem, that we have been unable to overcome, is properly cloning and compressing the image file of the system. While this shouldn't be that difficult, we have still been unable to reproduce proper results. We will still try to overcome the problem and have had some ideas on fixing it, but this problem will not be fixed within the deadline.

To our knowledge all other major problems have been fixed, so our next objective is fullfilling our todo list, which includes most features we want to see in our project before releasing the first Stable version (1.0).

## Why we chose to do things our way and why we didn't do some things we could

During the making of the project we have come across many tough decisions and we had to decide which way we want to go. We are confident our decisions were best for the project, but there are still some things we wish we changed.

One of the proposed additions to the project was automatic building generation in the world using WorldEdit and some scripts. While we explored the idea, we have concluded that this couldn't be properly implemented within the deadline, so we have added the idea to our todo list. Many of our other decisions were based on the deadline, but will be improved in our free time, after the project has ended.

We also had to make a tough decision about customisation vs. simplicity, where we chose simplicity, as we believe our target demographic, parents, do not have the proper knowledge or are even willing to deal with more opions than needed. That is why we removed some features in the Web management Console. One of the more advanced features we still left included is the RCON Console, which could offer even advanced users the customisation they require.
