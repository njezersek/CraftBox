				CraftBox is a RaspberryPi powered Local Area Network Minecraft Server intended for parents who don't want their kids playing on public servers until they are old enough. The reasons might vary, but we believe parents want to allow their children to play Minecraft, it's just that public servers could be full of Griefers or people who swear or insult. This isn't the environment that Notch envisioned.
